## Requirements

Build a weather application that:
- Provides a city search input and fetches current weather data from a public API (e.g. OpenWeatherMap)
- Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather condition icon
- Shows a 5-day forecast with daily high/low temperatures
- Handles invalid city names with a user-friendly error message
- Stores the last searched city in `localStorage` and auto-loads it on mount
- Supports toggling between Celsius and Fahrenheit without re-fetching
