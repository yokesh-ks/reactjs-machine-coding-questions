## Requirements

Build a table generator component that:
- Provides two number inputs: rows (1–10) and columns (1–10)
- Renders an HTML `<table>` where each cell displays its `(row, col)` coordinate
- Adds a header row with column numbers and a header column with row numbers
- Updates the table in real-time as the user changes the row or column input
- Highlights cells on hover
- Validates that both inputs are within their allowed range; shows an error if not
