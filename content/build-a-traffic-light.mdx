## Requirements

Build a traffic light component that:
- Renders three circles stacked vertically representing red, yellow, and green lights
- Automatically cycles through the sequence red → green → yellow → red every configurable interval (default: 3s green, 1s yellow, 3s red)
- Illuminates only the active light; the other two remain dimmed
- Provides Start and Stop buttons to control the automatic cycling
- Allows manually clicking any light to override the current state and resume cycling from that light
- Accepts `redDuration`, `yellowDuration`, and `greenDuration` props (in ms)
