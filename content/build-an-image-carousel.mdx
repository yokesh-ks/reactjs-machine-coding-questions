## Requirements

Build an image carousel component that:
- Accepts an array of image URLs as a prop and displays one image at a time
- Provides Previous and Next buttons to navigate between images
- Wraps around from the last image back to the first (and vice versa)
- Renders dot indicators showing the current image index; clicking a dot navigates to that image
- Auto-advances to the next image every 3 seconds (pauses on hover)
- Clears the auto-play interval on unmount to prevent memory leaks
