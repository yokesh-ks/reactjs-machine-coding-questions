## Requirements

Build a countdown timer that:
- Lets the user input a duration in minutes and seconds before starting
- Counts down to `00:00` once started
- Shows a Start, Pause, and Reset button with appropriate disabled states
- Displays the remaining time in `MM:SS` format
- Plays a sound or shows an alert when the timer reaches zero
- Prevents the timer from going below zero
