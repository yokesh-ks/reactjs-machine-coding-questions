## Requirements

Build a data table component that:
- Renders tabular data from a JSON array prop with configurable column definitions
- Supports ascending/descending sort by clicking a column header (only one column sorted at a time)
- Provides a global search input that filters all rows across all columns in real-time
- Supports individual column filters via input fields in the header row
- Implements client-side pagination with a configurable `pageSize`
- Allows selecting rows via checkboxes (including a "select all" header checkbox) and exposes the selection via a callback
