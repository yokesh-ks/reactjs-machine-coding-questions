## Requirements

Build a job board application that:
- Fetches job listings from a public API (e.g. Hacker News Jobs API) on mount
- Displays job title, company, location, and posting date for each listing
- Supports filtering by job type (Full-time, Part-time, Remote)
- Implements a "Load More" button that appends the next batch of results
- Shows a loading skeleton while data is being fetched
- Handles API errors with a user-friendly error message and retry option
