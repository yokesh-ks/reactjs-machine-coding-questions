## Requirements

Build a calculator application that:
- Displays a numeric input screen showing the current number or result
- Supports digits 0–9, decimal point, and the four basic operators: `+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`
- Evaluates the expression and shows the result when `=` is pressed
- Supports a clear (`C`) button that resets the calculator to its initial state
- Handles division by zero gracefully (display `Error`)
- Supports chaining operations (e.g. `3 + 5 × 2` without pressing `=` between each step)
