## Requirements

Build a theme toggle that:
- Renders a toggle switch or button to switch between light and dark modes
- Applies the selected theme by toggling a class or `data-theme` attribute on the `<html>` element
- Defines light and dark color schemes using CSS custom properties (variables)
- Persists the user's preference in `localStorage` so it survives page refreshes
- Reads the persisted preference on initial load; falls back to the OS preference via `prefers-color-scheme`
- Exposes the theme state via a `useTheme` custom hook for use in nested components
