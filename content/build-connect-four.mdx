## Requirements

Build a Connect Four game that:
- Renders a 7-column × 6-row grid where discs "fall" to the lowest empty row in a column
- Alternates turns between Player 1 (red) and Player 2 (yellow)
- Detects and announces a winner when a player connects four discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
- Highlights the winning four discs
- Detects a draw when all cells are filled with no winner
- Provides a "New Game" button to reset the board
