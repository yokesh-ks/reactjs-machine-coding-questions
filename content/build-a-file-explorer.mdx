## Requirements

Build a file explorer component that:
- Renders a nested tree from a recursive JSON structure (files and folders)
- Expands and collapses folders on click
- Shows different icons for files vs. folders
- Supports arbitrarily deep nesting using a recursive component
- Allows adding a new file or folder inside any directory
