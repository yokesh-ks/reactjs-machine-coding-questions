## Requirements

- **Name field** — a text input for the visitor's name
- **Email field** — an email input for the visitor's email address
- **Message field** — a `<textarea>` for the message, since it can be long
- **Submit button** — contains the text "Send"; clicking it submits the form
- The form and submission must be implemented entirely in HTML — do not use any JavaScript or framework-specific features
- There is no need for client-side validation; validation will be handled on the server side
