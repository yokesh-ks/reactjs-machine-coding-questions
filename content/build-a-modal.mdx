## Requirements

Build a modal dialog component that:
- Renders its content via `ReactDOM.createPortal` outside the root DOM tree
- Opens and closes based on an `isOpen` prop controlled by the parent
- Closes when the user clicks the backdrop
- Closes when the user presses the `Escape` key
- Traps focus inside the modal while it is open
- Prevents background scroll when the modal is visible
