## Requirements

Build an accordion component that displays a list of vertically stacked sections, each containing a title and content snippet. Some HTML is provided as example contents along with a chevron icon.

**Requirements**
- By default, all sections are collapsed and hidden from view
- Clicking on a section title toggles the contents:
  - If collapsed → expands and displays the content
  - If expanded → collapses and hides the content
- The sections are independent of each other

**Notes**
- The focus of this question is on functionality, not styling. Do not spend too much time writing custom CSS.
- You may modify the markup (e.g. adding ids, data attributes, replacing some tags, etc.) and use client-side rendering instead.
- Think about ways to improve the user experience (bonus credit in interviews).
