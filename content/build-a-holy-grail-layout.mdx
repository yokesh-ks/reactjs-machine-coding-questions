## Requirements

Build the classic Holy Grail layout that:
- Renders a full-page layout with a header at the top and a footer at the bottom
- Has a three-column middle section: left sidebar, main content, and right sidebar
- The left and right sidebars have a fixed width; the main content stretches to fill the remaining space
- The layout is implemented using CSS Flexbox or CSS Grid (no floats or tables)
- The middle section should fill all available vertical space between header and footer
- Is responsive: on narrow viewports the sidebars stack above and below the main content
