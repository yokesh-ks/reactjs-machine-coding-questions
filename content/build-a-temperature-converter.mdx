## Requirements

Build a temperature converter that:
- Displays three input fields: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin
- When the user types in any field, immediately updates the other two fields with the converted values
- Rounds all values to two decimal places
- Clears the other fields (or shows an empty string) when the active field is cleared
- Validates that the entered temperature is not below absolute zero (−273.15 °C / 0 K / −459.67 °F)
- Marks invalid inputs with a red border and an error tooltip
