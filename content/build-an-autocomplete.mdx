## Requirements

Build an autocomplete input component that:
- Fetches suggestions from an API with a 300ms debounce on the input
- Renders a dropdown list of matching suggestions below the input
- Supports keyboard navigation: `ArrowDown` / `ArrowUp` to move, `Enter` to select, `Escape` to close
- Populates the input with the selected suggestion and closes the dropdown
- Handles loading and empty-result states in the dropdown
- Closes the dropdown when the user clicks outside the component
