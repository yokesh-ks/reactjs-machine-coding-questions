## Requirements

Build a nested checkbox tree that:
- Renders a recursive tree of checkboxes from a nested JSON structure
- Checking a parent checks all its descendants; unchecking a parent unchecks all descendants
- Shows a parent checkbox as **indeterminate** when only some of its children are checked
- Checking all children of a parent automatically checks the parent
- Unchecking any child of a fully-checked parent sets it to indeterminate (if others remain checked) or unchecked
- Uses the `ref.indeterminate` DOM property to set the indeterminate visual state on the `<input type="checkbox">`
