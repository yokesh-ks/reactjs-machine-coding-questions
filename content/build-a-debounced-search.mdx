## Requirements

Build a debounced search input that:
- Fires an API call only after the user stops typing for 500ms
- Extracts the debounce logic into a reusable `useDebounce` custom hook
- Shows a loading spinner while the request is in flight
- Renders the results list once data arrives
- Handles the case where a newer request supersedes an older one (race condition)
