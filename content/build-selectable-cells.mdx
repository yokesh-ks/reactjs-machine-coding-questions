## Requirements

Build a selectable cells grid that:
- Renders an N×M grid of cells
- Clicking a cell selects it and deselects all others (single selection)
- `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + click toggles a cell's selection without affecting other selected cells
- `Shift` + click selects the rectangular range between the last clicked cell and the current one
- Highlights all selected cells with a distinct background color
- Displays the count of currently selected cells below the grid
