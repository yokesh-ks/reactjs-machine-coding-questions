## Requirements

Build an OTP (One-Time Password) input component that:
- Renders N individual single-digit input boxes (default 6)
- Automatically moves focus to the next box when a digit is entered
- Moves focus back to the previous box when `Backspace` is pressed on an empty box
- Handles pasting a full OTP string and distributes digits across all boxes
- Only accepts numeric characters; ignores letters and special characters
- Calls an `onComplete(otp: string)` callback when all boxes are filled
