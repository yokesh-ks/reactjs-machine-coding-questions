## Requirements

Build a like button component that:
- Displays a heart icon and a like count
- Toggles between liked (filled heart) and unliked (outline heart) on click
- Increments the count when liked and decrements when unliked
- Plays a short scale-up CSS animation on the heart icon when liked
- Accepts an initial `likeCount` and `isLiked` prop
- Calls an optional `onToggle(isLiked)` callback prop when toggled
