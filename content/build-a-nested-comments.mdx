## Requirements

Build a nested comments section that:
- Renders a tree of comments from a nested JSON structure
- Allows adding a reply to any comment at any depth
- Allows deleting any comment (and all its descendants)
- Shows a "Reply" toggle that expands an inline reply input
- Displays the author name, timestamp, and comment body for each comment
- Uses `useContext` or prop drilling to share add/delete handlers down the tree
