## Requirements

Build a digital clock that:
- Displays the current local time updating every second in `HH:MM:SS` format
- Toggles between 12-hour (with AM/PM) and 24-hour display modes via a button
- Shows the current date (day, month, year) below the time
- Allows the user to select a different timezone from a dropdown and displays that timezone's time
- Uses `useEffect` with `setInterval` and clears the interval on unmount
- Adds a blinking colon separator between hours, minutes, and seconds
