## Requirements

Build a password generator that:
- Generates a random password on load and on a "Generate" button click
- Provides controls to configure: length (slider, 8–32), include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Displays a password strength indicator (Weak / Medium / Strong) based on length and character variety
- Includes a "Copy to clipboard" button that briefly shows a "Copied!" confirmation
- Ensures at least one character from each selected character set appears in the output
- Uses `crypto.getRandomValues` instead of `Math.random` for secure randomness
