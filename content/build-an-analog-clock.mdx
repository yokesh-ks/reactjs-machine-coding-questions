## Requirements

Build an analog clock using SVG that:
- Renders a circular clock face with 12 hour markers and 60 minute tick marks
- Displays three hands: hour, minute, and second, each with correct proportional lengths
- Rotates the hands in real time by computing angles from the current time using trigonometry
- Smooth-sweeps the second hand using CSS transitions or `requestAnimationFrame`
- Shows the current date below the clock face
- Accepts a `timezone` prop and displays the correct time for that timezone
