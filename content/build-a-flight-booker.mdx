## Requirements

Build a flight booker form that:
- Provides a dropdown to choose between "One-way flight" and "Round trip"
- Renders a departure date field (always enabled) and a return date field (disabled for one-way trips)
- Validates that the return date is not earlier than the departure date; disables the Book button if invalid
- Shows an error message next to any invalid date field
- Displays a confirmation message summarising the booking details when the Book button is clicked
- Resets the form when the user dismisses the confirmation
