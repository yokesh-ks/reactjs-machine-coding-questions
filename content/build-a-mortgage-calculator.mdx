## Requirements

Build a mortgage calculator that:
- Accepts three inputs: loan principal, annual interest rate (%), and loan term (years)
- Computes and displays the monthly payment using the standard amortization formula
- Shows the total payment over the loan term and the total interest paid
- Updates the results in real-time as the user changes any input
- Validates inputs — all values must be positive numbers; shows inline error messages otherwise
- Renders an amortization summary table breaking down principal vs. interest per year
