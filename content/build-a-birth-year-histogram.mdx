## Requirements

Build a birth year histogram component that:
- Accepts an array of birth years as a prop
- Groups years into decade buckets (e.g. 1980s, 1990s, 2000s) and counts entries per bucket
- Renders a vertical bar chart where each bar's height is proportional to the bucket count
- Labels each bar with the decade and its count
- Scales bar heights relative to the bucket with the highest count (which reaches 100% height)
- Uses only React and CSS — no third-party charting library
