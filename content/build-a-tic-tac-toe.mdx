## Requirements

Build a Tic-Tac-Toe game that:
- Renders a 3×3 grid where two players alternate marking squares with X and O
- Detects and announces the winner (or a draw) after each move
- Highlights the winning combination of squares
- Maintains a move history list on the side
- Allows jumping back to any previous move (time-travel feature)
- Resets the board for a new game via a "Restart" button
