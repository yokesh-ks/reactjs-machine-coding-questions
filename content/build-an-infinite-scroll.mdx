## Requirements

Build an infinite scroll list that:
- Loads the first page of items on mount
- Appends the next page when the user scrolls to a sentinel element at the bottom
- Uses `IntersectionObserver` (not scroll event listeners) to detect the bottom
- Shows a loading indicator while fetching the next page
- Stops fetching when all pages have been loaded
- Handles fetch errors gracefully with a retry option
