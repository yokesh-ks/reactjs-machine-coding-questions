## Requirements

Build a popover component that:
- Renders a trigger element (button) and a floating content panel
- Toggles the panel open/closed when the trigger is clicked
- Positions the panel above, below, left, or right of the trigger based on a `placement` prop
- Adjusts position automatically if the panel would overflow the viewport
- Closes when the user clicks outside both the trigger and the panel
- Closes when the `Escape` key is pressed
