## Requirements

Build a dice roller application that:
- Renders a visual dice face showing dots for the current value (1–6)
- Animates the dice with a brief shake/spin CSS animation each time it is rolled
- Supports rolling multiple dice simultaneously (configurable count via a selector)
- Displays the sum of all dice in the current roll
- Maintains a scrollable roll history list showing each roll's results and sum
- Provides a "Clear History" button to wipe the history list
