## Requirements

Build a pagination component that:
- Accepts a large dataset and a `pageSize` prop
- Displays only the current page's records
- Renders page number buttons with Previous and Next controls
- Disables Previous on page 1 and Next on the last page
- Highlights the active page number
- Uses `useMemo` to avoid slicing the data on every render
