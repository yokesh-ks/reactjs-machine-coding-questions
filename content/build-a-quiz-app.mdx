## Requirements

Build a quiz application that:
- Displays one question at a time from a predefined questions array, each with four options
- Highlights the selected answer green (correct) or red (incorrect) after selection
- Disables all options once an answer is submitted to prevent changes
- Advances to the next question via a "Next" button
- Tracks and displays the score (correct answers out of total)
- Shows a results summary screen at the end with the final score and a "Restart" option
