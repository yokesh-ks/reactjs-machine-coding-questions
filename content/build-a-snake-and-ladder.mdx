## Requirements

Build a Snake and Ladder board game that:
- Renders a 10×10 numbered board with snakes and ladders drawn or marked at their positions
- Supports two players with distinct token colors, both starting off the board
- Rolls a dice (1–6) on button click and moves the current player's token accordingly
- Teleports the token to the ladder top if it lands on a ladder base, or snake tail if it lands on a snake head
- Alternates turns between the two players after each roll
- Detects when a player reaches exactly square 100 and declares them the winner
