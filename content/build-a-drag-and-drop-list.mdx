## Requirements

Build a drag-and-drop reorderable list that:
- Renders a vertical list of items, each with a drag handle
- Allows dragging an item and dropping it at a new position in the list
- Reorders the underlying state array when a drop occurs
- Provides visual feedback: the dragged item appears semi-transparent and the drop target is highlighted
- Works correctly for both upward and downward reordering
- Uses only the native HTML5 `draggable` API (no third-party libraries)
