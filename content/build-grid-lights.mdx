## Requirements

Build an interactive grid lights component that:
- Renders a configurable N×M grid of cells (e.g. 3×3 by default)
- Turns a cell on (highlighted) when clicked, and keeps track of the order cells were activated
- Lights up each cell sequentially on a timer (e.g. every 300ms) when the "Play" button is pressed
- Resets all cells to off when the "Reset" button is pressed
- Turns off cells one by one in reverse order during the reset animation
- Accepts `rows` and `cols` as props
