## Requirements

Build a transfer list component that:
- Renders two side-by-side lists: "Available" and "Selected"
- Each item has a checkbox; checking items marks them for transfer
- Provides four action buttons between the lists: Move all right, Move checked right, Move checked left, Move all left
- Updates the lists immediately when a transfer button is clicked and clears all checkmarks
- Shows the count of checked items on each side
- Disables the "Move right" buttons when nothing is checked in the left list (and vice versa)
