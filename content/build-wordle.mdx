## Requirements

Build a Wordle clone that:
- Picks a random 5-letter target word from a predefined word list on each game start
- Renders a 6×5 grid; each row is one guess attempt
- Accepts keyboard input (physical or an on-screen virtual keyboard) for letter entry and submission
- Colors each letter tile after submission: **green** (correct position), **yellow** (wrong position), **grey** (not in word)
- Updates the on-screen keyboard keys with the same color feedback
- Ends the game when the correct word is guessed (win) or all 6 attempts are used (loss), and reveals the target word
