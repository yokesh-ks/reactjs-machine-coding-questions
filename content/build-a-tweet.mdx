- Accepts a tweet object as a prop containing: author name, handle, avatar URL, timestamp, text content, and optional image
- Renders the author avatar, name, and handle in the header row
- Displays the tweet text with `@mentions` and `#hashtags` highlighted in blue
- Shows an optional attached image below the text
- Renders action buttons for Like, Retweet, Reply, and Share with their respective counts
- Toggles the liked state on clicking the Like button, updating the count accordingly
