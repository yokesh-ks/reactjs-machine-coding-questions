## Requirements

Build a custom dropdown component that:
- Toggles an options list open/closed when the trigger button is clicked
- Closes when the user clicks anywhere outside the component (using `useRef` + `useEffect`)
- Supports keyboard navigation: `ArrowDown` / `ArrowUp` to move focus, `Enter` to select, `Escape` to close
- Displays the currently selected option as the button label (falls back to a placeholder)
- Accepts an `options` array and an `onChange` callback as props
- Is accessible with proper `aria-expanded`, `aria-haspopup`, and `role="listbox"` attributes
