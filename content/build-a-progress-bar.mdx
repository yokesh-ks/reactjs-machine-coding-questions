## Requirements

Build a progress bar component that:
- Accepts a `value` prop (0–100) and visually fills the bar proportionally
- Animates the width change smoothly using CSS transitions when `value` changes
- Displays the percentage label inside or beside the bar
- Accepts a `color` prop to support different themes (e.g. success, warning, error)
- Includes proper ARIA attributes (`role="progressbar"`, `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`)
- Shows an indeterminate animated state when `value` is `null` or `undefined`
